# Cache Warm vs. Cold Cache Benchmark Results

This document summarizes the results of benchmarking a cache warming technique by comparing performance with a warm cache versus a cold cache.

## What is Cache Warming?

**Cache warming** refers to the practice of loading data into the CPU cache before it is actually needed in order to improve performance. By ensuring that frequently accessed data is already in the cache, you can reduce the time spent accessing slower main memory. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where predictable access patterns are known.

### Key Characteristics of Cache Warming:
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces the time required to access data by keeping it in the cache.
- **Reduced Cache Misses**: Decreases the frequency of cache misses, which leads to faster data retrieval.
- **Predictable Access Patterns**: Best utilized in situations where data access patterns can be anticipated.

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark compares two scenarios:

- **Warm Cache** (`BM_CacheWarm`): Measures performance with data already loaded in the cache.
- **Cold Cache** (`BM_CacheCold`): Measures performance with data that is not yet in the cache.

### Results

| Benchmark         | Time (ns)  | CPU Time (ns) | Iterations |
|-------------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **Warm Cache**    | 10,829,378 | 10,829,058    | 64         |
| **Cold Cache**    | 96,361,937 | 96,358,521    | 7          |

### Performance Counter Stats

**Warm Cache**:
- **Instructions**: 22,110,052,983 (cpu_core)
- **Cache References**: 51,686,328 (cpu_core)
- **Cache Misses**: 14,014,944 (cpu_core)

**Cold Cache**:
- **Instructions**: 6,799,718,396 (cpu_core)
- **Cache References**: 88,531,421 (cpu_core)
- **Cache Misses**: 42,274,432 (cpu_core)

### Interpretation

- **Warm Cache**:
  - Took approximately **10,829,378 nanoseconds** to complete.
  - Shows significantly fewer cache misses and lower cache reference counts compared to the cold cache scenario.

- **Cold Cache**:
  - Took approximately **96,361,937 nanoseconds** to complete.
  - Exhibited a much higher number of cache misses and cache references, indicating that the data was not preloaded into the cache.

### Conclusion

The results demonstrate a significant performance improvement with cache warming. When the cache is warm, the benchmark completes substantially faster, indicating reduced latency due to fewer cache misses and better utilization of the cache. This highlights the effectiveness of cache warming in optimizing performance.

## Running the Benchmark

To reproduce these results, navigate to the `cache_warming` directory and follow these steps:

1. **Build the Benchmark**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

2. **Run the Benchmark**:
    ```bash
    ./mybenchmark
    ```

The results will be displayed in the terminal after the benchmark completes.
