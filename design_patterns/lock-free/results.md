# Lock-Free Benchmark Results

This document summarizes the results of benchmarking atomic operations against mutex locks in a multithreaded environment for 10,000 iterations.

## What is Lock-Free Programming?

Lock-free programming is a concurrency control method that avoids the use of traditional locks (like mutexes) to manage access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment. Instead, it relies on atomic operations that ensure data integrity without requiring threads to wait for each other. This method is particularly beneficial in low-latency, high-performance applications because it reduces the risk of thread contention, deadlocks, and other issues associated with lock-based synchronization.

### Key Characteristics of Lock-Free Programming:
- **Non-blocking**: Threads do not wait for a lock to become available; they can always make progress.
- **Atomicity**: Operations on shared resources are performed atomically, meaning they complete without interruption.
- **Reduced Contention**: With no locks to acquire, there's less chance of threads being blocked, which improves overall performance.

Lock-free programming is often used in scenarios where performance is critical, such as real-time systems, networking, and high-frequency trading applications.

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark compares two synchronization techniques:

- **Atomic Operations** (`BM_Atomic/10000`)
- **Mutex Locks** (`BM_Mutex/10000`)

### Results

| Benchmark       | Time (ns)  | CPU Time (ns) | Iterations |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **BM_Atomic/10000** | 50,357     | 50,358        | 13,484     |
| **BM_Mutex/10000**  | 123,688    | 123,690       | 5,569      |

### Interpretation

- **Atomic Operations**:
  - Completed 10,000 iterations in approximately **50,357 nanoseconds**.
  - Significantly more efficient with a higher number of iterations per second.

- **Mutex Locks**:
  - Took approximately **123,688 nanoseconds** to complete 10,000 iterations.
  - Considerably slower than atomic operations with fewer iterations per second.

### Conclusion

The results demonstrate that atomic operations are generally more performant than mutex locks in scenarios requiring minimal synchronization. Atomic operations are preferred in low-latency applications where performance is critical.

## Running the Benchmark

To reproduce these results, navigate to the `lock-free` directory and follow these steps:

1. **Build the Benchmark**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

2. **Run the Benchmark**:
    ```bash
    ./mybenchmark
    ```

The results will be displayed in the terminal after the benchmark completes.
