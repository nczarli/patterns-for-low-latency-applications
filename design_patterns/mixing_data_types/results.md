# Mixed vs. Unmixed Float and Double Processing Benchmark Results

This document summarizes the results of benchmarking the performance impact of mixing and unmixed usage of float and double types in C++.

## What is Mixed vs. Unmixed Float and Double Processing?

- **Mixed Float and Double Processing**:
  - Refers to operations where both `float` and `double` data types are used together in expressions. Mixing these types can sometimes result in implicit type conversions, which might affect performance.

- **Unmixed Float and Double Processing**:
  - Involves using only one data type consistently within operations, such as performing operations solely with `float` or solely with `double`. This can avoid the overhead of type conversion and potentially improve performance.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Mixed Processing**: May involve type conversion and additional overhead if not optimized properly.
- **Unmixed Processing**: Consistent use of a single data type can lead to more straightforward computation and potentially better performance.

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark compares two scenarios:

- **Mixed Float and Double Processing** (`BM_MixedFloatDouble`): Operations involving both `float` and `double` types.
- **Unmixed Float and Double Processing** (`BM_UnmixedFloatDouble`): Operations involving only `float` types.

### Results

| Benchmark                  | Time (ns) | CPU Time (ns) | Iterations |
|----------------------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **BM_MixedFloatDouble**    | 10.5      | 10.5          | 66,021,989 |
| **BM_UnmixedFloatDouble**  | 10.4      | 10.4          | 66,852,338 |

### Interpretation

- **Mixed Float and Double Processing**:
  - Each operation took approximately **10.5 nanoseconds**.
  - The number of iterations achieved was slightly lower compared to unmixed processing.

- **Unmixed Float and Double Processing**:
  - Each operation took approximately **10.4 nanoseconds**.
  - The unmixed processing demonstrated a marginally better performance with a higher number of iterations.

### Conclusion

The results indicate that while there is a minimal difference between mixed and unmixed processing, unmixed processing with consistent data types shows a slight performance advantage. This suggests that avoiding implicit type conversions and sticking to a single data type for computations can offer marginal performance improvements.

**Warning**: The results may be affected by CPU scaling and debug build settings. Performance measurements could be noisy and incur extra overhead.

## Running the Benchmark

To reproduce these results, navigate to the `mixing_data_types` directory and follow these steps:

1. **Build the Benchmark**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

2. **Run the Benchmark**:
    ```bash
    ./mybenchmark
    ```

The results will be displayed in the terminal after the benchmark completes.
