# Slow Path Removal Benchmark Results

This document summarizes the results of benchmarking the impact of removing the slow path from a code execution path in C++.

## What is Slow Path Removal?

In performance optimization, the term **slow path** refers to code paths that are executed infrequently but are costly in terms of performance when they are executed. These paths are typically associated with error handling or other less frequent operations. **Slow path removal** is a technique used to optimize performance by avoiding or minimizing the execution of these slow paths during critical or frequent operations.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Hot Path**: The primary, frequently executed code path that should be optimized for performance.
- **Slow Path**: The less frequently executed code path that handles rare or exceptional cases.
- **Optimization**: By isolating slow paths into separate functions or optimizing them away, overall performance can be improved for the hot path.

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark compares two scenarios:

- **Slow Path Not Removed** (`SlowpathNotRemoved`): Slow path operations are performed directly within the main loop.
- **Slow Path Removed** (`SlowpathRemoved`): Slow path operations are encapsulated in a separate function (`HandleError`).

### Results

| Benchmark              | Time (ns) | CPU Time (ns) | Iterations |
|------------------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **SlowpathNotRemoved** | 9,040     | 9,040         | 70,428     |
| **SlowpathRemoved**    | 8,856     | 8,856         | 76,782     |

### Interpretation

- **Slow Path Not Removed**:
  - Each operation took approximately **9,040 nanoseconds**.
  - Achieved a total of 70,428 iterations.

- **Slow Path Removed**:
  - Each operation took approximately **8,856 nanoseconds**.
  - Achieved a total of 76,782 iterations.

### Conclusion

The results show that removing the slow path from the main execution loop leads to improved performance. With the slow path encapsulated in a separate function, the overall execution time decreased, and the number of iterations increased. This demonstrates that isolating infrequent and costly operations can enhance the performance of frequently executed code paths.

## Running the Benchmark

To reproduce these results, navigate to the `slowpath` directory and follow these steps:

1. **Build the Benchmark**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

2. **Run the Benchmark**:
    ```bash
    ./mybenchmark
    ```

The results will be displayed in the terminal after the benchmark completes.
