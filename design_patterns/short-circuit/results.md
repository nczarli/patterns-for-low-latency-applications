# Short-Circuit Evaluation Benchmark Results

This document summarizes the results of benchmarking the performance impact of short-circuit evaluation versus non-short-circuit evaluation in C++.

## What is Short-Circuit Evaluation?

Short-circuit evaluation is a technique used in logical expressions to avoid unnecessary computations. When evaluating logical conditions, the expression is evaluated from left to right, and if the result can be determined early, the evaluation stops. This technique can save computation time and improve performance.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Efficiency**: Short-circuit evaluation prevents the evaluation of expressions that are unnecessary for determining the result.
- **Performance Improvement**: By avoiding expensive or redundant computations, short-circuit evaluation can reduce overall execution time.
- **Predictability**: The order of evaluation is consistent, which can lead to more predictable performance in complex logical expressions.

Short-circuit evaluation is particularly useful in scenarios where the right-hand side of a logical expression is computationally expensive and can be avoided if the left-hand side determines the outcome.

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark compares two scenarios:

- **No Short-Circuit Evaluation** (`BM_NoShortCircuit`): Evaluating both conditions in a logical OR without short-circuiting.
- **With Short-Circuit Evaluation** (`BM_ShortCircuit`): Evaluating conditions using logical OR with short-circuiting.

| Benchmark                  | Time (ns)    | CPU Time (ns) | Iterations |
|----------------------------|--------------|---------------|------------|

| **BM_ShortCircuit/512**    | 115,825,579  | 115,825,908   | 6          |
| **BM_ShortCircuit/4096**   | 934,248,185  | 934,241,739   | 1          |
| **BM_ShortCircuit/8192**   | 1,822,870,217| 1,822,849,885 | 1          |

### Interpretation

- **No Short-Circuit Evaluation**:
  - The execution time increases significantly as the range of iterations grows.
  - For smaller ranges (e.g., 8), the performance is relatively better, but it deteriorates sharply with larger ranges.

- **Short-Circuit Evaluation**:
  - Shows significantly better performance, particularly for larger iteration ranges.
  - The performance advantage is evident across all tested ranges, with the difference becoming more pronounced as the iteration count increases.

### Conclusion

The results demonstrate that short-circuit evaluation provides a substantial performance improvement over non-short-circuit evaluation, especially in scenarios with large iteration counts. By avoiding the evaluation of unnecessary conditions, short-circuit evaluation reduces execution time and enhances overall performance.
