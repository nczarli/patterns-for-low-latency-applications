# Signed vs. Unsigned Integer Benchmark Results

This document summarizes the results of benchmarking the performance impact of using signed versus unsigned integers in C++.

## What are Signed and Unsigned Integers?

- **Signed Integers**:
  - Can represent both positive and negative values.
  - Typically used when the range of possible values includes negative numbers.

- **Unsigned Integers**:
  - Can only represent non-negative values (0 and positive numbers).
  - Generally used when negative values are not needed, allowing for a larger positive range within the same number of bits.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Signed Integers**: Include an extra bit for the sign, which can affect operations involving the range of values and performance.
- **Unsigned Integers**: Utilize all available bits for representing positive values, which can sometimes result in better performance for certain operations due to simpler arithmetic operations and lack of sign management.

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark compares two scenarios:

- **Signed Integer Processing** (`BM_Signed`): Using signed integers in a loop.
- **Unsigned Integer Processing** (`BM_Unsigned`): Using unsigned integers in a loop.

### Results

| Benchmark        | Time (ns) | CPU Time (ns) | Iterations |
|------------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **BM_Signed**    | 13.8      | 13.8          | 50,191,895 |
| **BM_Unsigned**  | 13.7      | 13.7          | 48,884,658 |

### Interpretation

- **Signed Integer Processing**:
  - Each operation took approximately **13.8 nanoseconds**.
  - The number of iterations achieved was slightly higher compared to unsigned processing.

- **Unsigned Integer Processing**:
  - Each operation took approximately **13.7 nanoseconds**.
  - The number of iterations was marginally lower than for signed processing.

### Conclusion

The results indicate a minor difference between signed and unsigned integer processing. In this benchmark, unsigned integers showed a slight performance advantage, but the difference is minimal. This suggests that for operations that do not require negative numbers, using unsigned integers might offer a slight edge in performance.

## Running the Benchmark

To reproduce these results, navigate to the `signed_and_unsigned` directory and follow these steps:

1. **Build the Benchmark**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

2. **Run the Benchmark**:
    ```bash
    ./mybenchmark
    ```

The results will be displayed in the terminal after the benchmark completes.
