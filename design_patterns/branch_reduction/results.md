# Branching vs. Reduced Branching Benchmark Results

This document summarizes the results of benchmarking two different approaches to handling conditional logic in C++: traditional branching versus reduced branching using flags.

## What is Branching and Reduced Branching?

**Branching** refers to the use of conditional statements (e.g., `if`, `else if`, `else`) to control the flow of execution in a program. While straightforward, this approach can lead to performance inefficiencies due to frequent branching and potential cache misses.

**Reduced Branching** involves using flags or bitwise operations to handle multiple conditions in a more efficient manner. By consolidating multiple conditional checks into a single operation, this method can reduce the number of branching instructions and improve performance.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Branching**: Each condition is checked individually, which can result in multiple branches and potential performance penalties.
- **Reduced Branching**: Uses flags to handle multiple conditions in a single operation, which minimizes branching and can lead to better performance.

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark compares two approaches to conditional logic:

- **Branching** (`Branching`): Uses traditional conditional checks with `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
- **Reduced Branching** (`ReducedBranching`): Uses flags and bitwise operations to minimize branching.

### Results

| Benchmark            | Time (ns) | CPU Time (ns) | Iterations  |
|----------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Branching**        | 4.57      | 4.57          | 160,507,043 |
| **Reduced Branching**| 3.32      | 3.32          | 212,108,884 |

### Interpretation

- **Branching**:
  - Each operation took approximately **4.57 nanoseconds**.
  - This approach involves multiple conditional checks and branches, which can affect performance.

- **Reduced Branching**:
  - Each operation took approximately **3.32 nanoseconds**.
  - By using flags and consolidating checks, this approach reduces the number of branches and performs better.

### Conclusion

The results demonstrate that reduced branching, through the use of flags and bitwise operations, is generally more efficient than traditional branching. The reduced branching method shows a significant performance improvement, making it a better choice for scenarios where minimizing conditional logic overhead is crucial.

## Running the Benchmark
